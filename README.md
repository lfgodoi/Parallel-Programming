# parallel-programming
This repository contains:
- Simple projects that can be used as reference for understanding the parallel processing paradigm;
- Tests to justify the advantage of parallel programming on systems with real-time requirements;
- Different approaches to solve similar problems, since some features (such as PyOpenCL) do not yet have sufficient practical sources for consultation;
- Source codes applied to both GPU and FPGA implementations.
